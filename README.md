# CommonFunLib Java Library

This repository contains two Java classes: CommonFunctions and Generator.

## CommonFunctions

The CommonFunctions class provides a collection of commonly used functions for performing mathematical operations and manipulating variables and strings. The following functions are available:

- `isEven`: Checks if a number is even.
- `isOdd`: Checks if a number is odd.
- `factorial`: Calculates the factorial of a number.
- `gcd`: Calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
- `lcm`: Calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.
- `isPrime`: Checks if a number is prime.
- `swapVariableValue`: Swaps the values of two variables.
- `reverseString`: Reverses a string.

## Generator

The Generator class provides functions for generating random numbers and names. The following functions are available:

- `generateRandomNumber`: Generates a random number between a minimum and maximum value.
- `generateRandomName`: Generates a random name by combining a random first name with a random last name.

## Getting started

To use these classes in your Java project, simply include the source files in your project and `import` the classes as needed.

- `import` CommonFunctions;
- `import` Generator;

## Credits

The  `CommonFunctions` class was written by AJ4200 at GitHub.

The `Generator` class was also written by AJ4200 at GitHub and uses data `files first_names.txt` and `last_names.txt` for generating random names.
